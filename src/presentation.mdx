## OOP - Strengths

>I want to have total control of what my objects look like by updating my class.

### Example Application Domains

<Step>

- health care
- banking 
- insurance
- sales
- eCommerce
- accounting
- booking software for restaurants or hotels 


</Step>



</Layout>

<Note>

Before we dive too deeply into the code today, I want to discuss some situations that lend themselves to Object Oriented Programming.

OO design is well suited for situations where I want to have total control of what my objects look like by updating my class.

Some example application domains where OO design would really shine are: 

any application modeling a real world domain that has lots of government regulations with specific data storage requirements (**reveal** health care, banking and insurance). Those would all be great application domains to employ object oriented programming.

Other types of applications that would work well are applications that are designed to help workers accomplish well established tasks that have consistent data requirements (**reveal**: sales, eCommerce, accounting, booking software for restaurants or hotels)

In all of those cases, Object Oriented design would help me clearly define the responsibilities of the different objects in my program and how they are related to other objects in the program.

## OOP - Weaknesses

>Because I have total control, I don't have the flexibility to change my object's attributes without changing my class first.

<Step>

- Changes are more expensive, so iterations may take longer
- Handling data from external data sources can be challenging

</Step>
  
</Layout>

<Note>

On the flip side, because I have total control over my objects via their class, I don't have the flexibility to change my object's attributes without changing my class first.

- **reveal**: Changes are more expensive, so iterations may take longer 
- If I were building a social media application, being able to iterate quickly and experiment with new features without having to make a more significant commitment to a change is a benefit.
- **reveal**: Handling data from external data sources can be challenging
- If we're in a situation where we're interacting with data from multiple external sources and we don't have control over the attributes present, an object oriented approach can slow us down.
- Think about the difference between having a Dog class and having a hash containing information about the dog. 
- If we want to add information to the dog hash, we just add it, but if we want Dog instances to have more information attached to them, we have to change the class first.

## Strengths of Object Oriented Design

---

<Step>

- It models the real world very well.
- Code reusability. 
- Encapsulation of data and behavior
- Clearly defined relationships
- Separation of Concerns

</Step>

</Layout>

<Note>

To summarize, the strengths of the Object Oriented approach are 
- **reveal**: it models the real world very well
- **reveal**: it offers code reusability by implementing 
- **reveal**: Encapsulation of data and behavior within classes, which allows us to model and 
- **reveal**: clearly define relationships between different ideas and real world objects in a way that is intuitive to follow.
- **reveael**: And finally, having different classes to reperesent the different actors in our program allows us to easily implement separation of concerns throughout our applications.

## Challenges with Object Oriented Design

--- 

<Step>

- OOP code is generally slower than functional code. 
- Testing Object Oriented code requires more setup
- Cost of the Wrong Abstraction

</Step>

</Layout>

<Note>

Here are some of the challenges with the Object Oriented approach
- **reveal**: OO code is generally slower than functional code, though this is sometimes not a significant difference.
- **reveal**: Testing OO code requires more setup because rather than passing an argument into a function and testing the return value, we generally have to create an object to encapsulate some data and then call a method on it and test the return value.
- **reveal**: Because so much abstraction is involved, if we're building an application where our requirements are rapidly changing, committing to the wrong abstraction can require more work to refactor and adjust than it would with functional code.

## Object Oriented vs Functional Code

<br/>

```rb
# Functional
def print_dog(dog_hash)
  # ...
end

print_dog(dog_hash)

# Object Oriented
class Dog
  def print
    # ...
  end
end

dog = Dog.new
dog.print
```



<Note>

On this slide we have a basic example of functional vs object oriented code.

At the top we have a functional approach to the `print_dog` method where the data is coming in from the dog_hash passed as an argument to the method. The information that we print out will be coming in from that argument. This is the version of the method that we wrote yesterday.

Below that, we have an object oriented version of the same method. Notice, in this case, we're calling the method `print` instead of `print_dog` because we'll be invoking this method on a `dog` instance: `dog.print`. If we named the method print_dog, we'd need to do something like: `dog.print_dog` which is a bit redundant.

Most importantly here, note that the print method does not accept an argument. This is because the dog's data that we want to display will be encapsulated within the dog object which means we don't need to accept it as a parameter.

## Key Refactors for Dog Walker CLI 

### Dog Class

We'll be creating a Dog class with the following characteristics:
<Step>

- attributes for name, age, breed, image_url, last_walked_at, last_fed_at
- add a `walk` method which sets the `last_walked_at` time to the current time
- add a `feed` method which sets the `last_fed_at` time to the current time
- add a `needs_a_walk?` method which returns `true` if the `last_walked_at` time either doesn't exist or is more than 4 hours ago and `false` if not
- add a `needs_a_meal?` method which returns `true` if the `last_fed_at` time either doesn't exist or is more than 6 hours ago and `false` if not
- add a `print` method which will handle printing the dog information to the standard output

## Key Refactors for Dog Walker CLI 
### Changes to CLI

In the `lib/dog_walker_cli.rb` file, we're going to make the following changes:
<Step>

- Add menu options for walking and feeding dogs
- After choosing those options, create logic to allow users to choose which dog they want to walk/feed
- refactor the parts of the cli that were expecting a dog hash to work with a dog instance instead.
  - `$dogs` should store an array of instances of the Dog class instead of an array of hashes
  - within the `add_dog` method, we'll create an instance of the `Dog` class instead of a hash
  - instead of calling print_dog and passing the dog hash, we'll invoke `print` directly on the dog

## The Updated CLI Program Flow
<br />

## Logistics

- The code for our cli will be written in the file `lib/dog_walker_cli.rb`. 
- We'll create another file called `lib/dog.rb` where we'll define our `Dog` class
- Again, we'll start our cli application by running the following command in our terminal:

<TerminalCommand>
bundle exec ./bin/run
</TerminalCommand>

- If we want to play around with our code without starting the CLI, we can run the following command in our terminal:

<TerminalCommand>
bundle exec ./bin/console
</TerminalCommand>

## New dependencies

For today, we're going to be working with `DateTime` objects to determine whether a dog needs a walk or a meal. There is a library that adds a bunch of useful methods for working with dates, so we're going to add it as a dependency. The gem is called `activesupport` (a part of the Ruby on Rails gem) and we can add it with the following command:

<TerminalCommand>
bundle add activesupport -v '~> 6.1'
</TerminalCommand>

This will update the Gemfile in the following way.

```ruby
# Gemfile
# ...

gem "activesupport", "~> 6.1"
```

## Configuring ActiveSupport 

Because we'll now be working with dates, we're going to add a few require statements to the `config/environment.rb` file to pull in the code we'll need:

```rb
# config/environment.rb
# ...
require "date"
require "active_support/core_ext/integer/time"
require "active_support/core_ext/date/calculations"
```

## What can we do now?

The integer extension allows us to convert integers into duration objects and do math on them. For example:

```rb
[1] pry(main)> 1.hours
=> 1 hour
[2] pry(main)> 1.hour.ago
=> 2022-05-17 09:00:11.068063 -0700
[3] pry(main)> Time.now < 1.hour.ago
=> false
[4] pry(main)> Time.now > 1.hour.ago
=> true
[5] pry(main)> 1.hour.ago.between?(2.hours.ago, Time.now)
=> true
```

This allows us to:
- compare times with reference to the current time
- use the `between?` method on a time to check if one time is between two other times (a beginning and ending time passed as arguments in that order).
- We can also take a time and add a duration to it to get another time after it by using the `.ago` and `.from_now` methods on any duration we choose

We'll be using this knowledge in our `needs_a_walk?` and `needs_a_meal?` methods.

## The Dog Class

- We want to be able to initialize a new instance of the Dog class with  name, age, breed, and image_url properties
- attributes: name, age, breed, image_url, last_walked_at, last_fed_at
  - getters and setters for all attributes
- `walk` method and `feed` method to update `last_walked_at` and `last_fed_at` attributes
- `print` method that will print out the dog's attributes and whether they need a meal or need a walk.

## Adding Logic to the CLI for choosing Dogs to Walk

<Step>

- Print out a numbered list of dogs (using [each with index](https://apidock.com/ruby/Enumerator/each_with_index))
- Take the user's choice (a string) and convert it to a number (index)
- Use the index to access the dog we want to walk/feed
- Set up a loop that will run until the user enters a valid choice
- Use the index to pull the dog out of $dogs
- call `walk` or `feed` on it
- call `print` on the dog
